# Object Oriented Programming: First Chapter
## Video games portraying human life 
### Human species as a class 
Several atrributes humans possess
+ Race
+ Gender
+ Age 
+ Height 
+ Hair color 
+ Weight 
+ Preffered food 
+ IQ
### Actions that Humans possess
+ Eat/drink/sleep
+ Automatic → Monitor Breathing & Temperature
+ Speak
+ Interact with Other Objects/humans
### You -> an object under the Human class
+ every human alive is under the Human Class
+ All humans have built-in attributes and perhaps make offspring that will be part pf the same class
+ Some humans will be more advantaged than others. However, not worry because all humans will lose their privilege to roam the playable open world 
## Object 
### What is an Object?
In the realm of Computer Science: 
+ "Object can be a variable, a data structure, a function, or a method; therefore, a location in memory having a value that can be referenced by an identifier"
In the realm of Object Oriented Programming:
+ "Similar to an object as in CS, an object in OOP is an instance of a class where this object can be either a variable, a function, a data structure or a combination of such"
## The OOP Paradigm 
### Object Orient Programming (OOP)
+ Used in programming to create longlasting software systems that contain modules 
+ creates programs by making things called **Objects**
+ Concentrates on the representation of information over the IPO procedure (OOP vs procedure-based programming)
+ The objective is to make an object that we can establish as well as give purpose to resolve dilemmas
### Conceptual differentiation 
#### procedure-based 
A human specimen may need
+ calculations 
+ Logic based analysis 
+ ability to do recurring steps 
+ database
#### OOP
Making an object that represents a human 
+ What do name do they go by 
+ Where do they live 
+ What functions are built into this function
“OOP focuses on how to manipulate the data of the object rather than the logic required to manipulate them”
## Deeper evaluation into an object
**Object**: A mixture of data & function code. This can represent states & habits that a real world object may possess

**Remember that an object is an occurence**

**states**: What information can be measured about the object 

**habits**: What the object can do (what functions it can perform) 

Object's Data -> known in OOP as: attributes

Object's Code -> known in OOP as: methods 
## An example of an instance representing a dog
### Dogs often possess the following **Attributes** 
+ Name 
+ Color
+ Breed
+ isHungry
+ isThirsty
### Dogs often possess the following **Methods**
+ bark()
+ eat()
+ sleep()

If more attributes are added to the dog then we have an occurance, thus, an **object** is created
## Classes & Objects
**Class**: conceptual illustration of every object that can be created by this set class that can instantiate objects when needed 

**Attributes** are often found in a Class

**Attributes** are known as an object's
