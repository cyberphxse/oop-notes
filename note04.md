# Object Oriented Programming note: part 4
## Iterable objects 
### Iterable objects
**Iterable Objects:** Objects that are able to be iterated through similar to a sequence 

**Examples**: Strings & lists (as well as sets & dictionaries)
+ remember that we are able to iterate through both strings & lists 
+ To grab single values w/o indexing, we can use for loops

**Important:**
+ The part of iterable object needs to be a sequence 
+ Just because something is iterable, it is not guaranteed that it can be indexed
